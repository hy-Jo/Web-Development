My Name Is Khan is a 2010 Indian Hindi-language drama film directed by Karan Johar, written by Shibani Bathija and Niranjan Iyengar, produced by Hiroo Yash Johar and Gauri Khan, and starring Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol in lead roles. Set in India and the United States, the film centers upon Rizwan Khan, an autistic Muslim man married to a woman, Mandira, who has a child, Sameer, in her previous relationship. Sameer is killed on the nature of prejudice following the September 11 attacks, and Mandira blames Rizwan, telling him not to come back until he can convince the President of the United States that he is not a terrorist. Rizwan takes Mandira's words literally and tries to meet the President so as to win her back.

   <summary>Plot</summary>
   <p>Rizwan Khan is an autistic Muslim child who grew up with his brother Zakir and his mother in a middle-class family in Borivali, Mumbai. His autism leads to special tutoring from a reclusive scholar and extra attention from his mother, all which leads to a heightened level of jealousy from Zakir, who eventually leaves his family for a life in San Francisco. Despite this, Zakir sponsors Rizwan to come and live with him after their mother's death. Zakir's wife Haseena diagnoses Rizwan as having Asperger’s syndrome. Rizwan also begins to work for Zakir's company, and meets a Hindu woman Mandira Rathore and her young son Sameer "Sam" Rathore, born from a previous marriage. Despite Zakir's uncertainty, they marry and live in the fictional locality of Banville, where Mandira and Sam surname themselves with "Khan." They also live next door to the Garrick family, comprising Mark and his wife. Sam is close to their young son Reese.</p>
